[nosetests]

# comment these out to get defaults, for some reason things like nocapture=0, False, FALSE detects as true

# let everything go to standard output
nocapture=1

# I shouldn't have to do this, by default nosetest should capture all loggers and show them, even let us
# set what level of logging we want from the logging-level variable but I'd be buggered if I can work
# out why it doesn't work as expected
nologcapture=1

# use to get really detailed info from nosetests (e.g. 3), not often necessary
#verbosity=1
